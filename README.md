## Installation:
You must have [version 4.2.5 of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell
...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml

If you want video support on your mod, simply do `haxelib git hxCodec https://github.com/polybiusproxy/hxCodec` on a Command prompt/PowerShell
otherwise, you can delete the "VIDEOS_ALLOWED" Line on Project.xml
