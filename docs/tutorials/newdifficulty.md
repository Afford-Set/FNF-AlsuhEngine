Go to the "Other" tab and write your difficulties names, IDs and Suffies. They should have the same length in terms of the number of difficulties. There should be default difficulty in between.

Freeplay is the same if you want.

Difficutlies IDs - The internal names of the difficulties.
Difficulties Names - Can any string except "\".
Difficulties Suffixes - Start with "-" and end with difficulty in lowercase.

### Files needed

You will need the difficulty image for the Story mode menu, and you're also gonna have to do the Crazy difficulty chart to all songs. Here's my Crazy difficulty image for an example:

Put this image inside ``mods/images/storymenu/menudifficulties/`` with it being named crazy.png and we're ready to go! If you've done everything alright, it should be in and working properly
